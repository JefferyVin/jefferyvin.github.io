### Sep 22, 2024

Ate half a pumpkin pie in the morning. The blood sugar crash caused my entire morning to be unproductive.
Thought about the court case. But there's not much I can do.
Played arknights, watched twitch, peeking at friend's discord call wondering what they are doing.
Wondering if SSM is something that is worth my time. Looked at UT/UIUC admission page again. I hope I get in.
Feel like I get stuck in a infinite loop very often (no compute -> no coding improvement -> doesnt justify getting more compute), but maybe I'm doing a bad job at getting myself out of this loop.
I wish tomorrow be a productive day, and I will figure out what I want to do with my life.

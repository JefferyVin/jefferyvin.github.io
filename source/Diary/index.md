### Sep 22, 2024

Ate half a pumpkin pie in the morning. The blood sugar crash caused my entire morning to be unproductive.
Thought about the court case. But there's not much I can do.
Played arknights, watched twitch, peeking at friend's discord call wondering what they are doing.
Wondering if SSM is something that is worth my time. Looked at UT/UIUC admission page again. I hope I get in.
Feel like I get stuck in a infinite loop very often (no compute -> no coding improvement -> doesnt justify getting more compute), but maybe I'm doing a bad job at getting myself out of this loop.
I wish tomorrow be a productive day, and I will figure out what I want to do with my life.

Slept the whole morning until 12. 
Went through Tri Dao's blog on Mamba-2 also tried streaming it, but idk why I did that.
Had a little chat with Ryan when he's playing overwatch.
Called dad, played arknights. How does my day feel so short?
Maybe I perform better when starved.
The peppermint tea I bought is not high quality but I like it so far.
Oh yeah I saw my mugshots when I was arrested. Definately not a good feeling. Also I was so fat back then (probably because living healthy wasn't my priority back then with all the stuff going on)
There are somedays that you wish you don't wake up tomorrow, and today might be that day. (I hope people read this in the future and be like, this guy is suicidal. But I mean... It is irresponsible for everyone around you if you end your own life, life is pain, and sometime you can only pray for jesus to cut that rope.)
I wish tomorrow to be a productive day, and I will break out of the infinite loop.

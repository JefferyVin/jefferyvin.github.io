### Sep 22, 2024

Ate half a pumpkin pie in the morning. The blood sugar crash caused my entire morning to be unproductive.
Thought about the court case. But there's not much I can do.
Played arknights, watched twitch, peeking at friend's discord call wondering what they are doing.
Wondering if SSM is something that is worth my time. Looked at UT/UIUC admission page again. I hope I get in.
Feel like I get stuck in a infinite loop very often (no compute -> no coding improvement -> doesnt justify getting more compute), but maybe I'm doing a bad job at getting myself out of this loop.
I wish tomorrow be a productive day, and I will figure out what I want to do with my life.

Slept the whole morning until 12. 
Went through Tri Dao's blog on Mamba-2 also tried streaming it, but idk why I did that.
Had a little chat with Ryan when he's playing overwatch.
Called dad, played arknights. How does my day feel so short?
Maybe I perform better when starved.
The peppermint tea I bought is not high quality but I like it so far.
Oh yeah I saw my mugshots when I was arrested. Definately not a good feeling. Also I was so fat back then (probably because living healthy wasn't my priority back then with all the stuff going on) (Oh yeah I think I want to live by myself as I don't believe my parents respect my personal decisions)
There are somedays that you wish you don't wake up tomorrow, and today might be that day. (I hope people read this in the future and be like, this guy is suicidal. But I mean... It is irresponsible for everyone around you if you end your own life, life is pain, and sometime you can only pray for jesus to cut that rope.)
I wish tomorrow to be a productive day, and I will break out of the infinite loop.

I may have stayed up pretty late (like 4 am ish maybe) watching 爱情公寓.
I dont know why I watch/do these things but somes days I feel lobotomized.
I wonder what I should do on these kind of days.
Wondering whether I can make a convertor from guitar songs to guitar tabs.

Spent my time thinking about knowledge distillation.
Somewhat productive day.
I've been pruning my existence away.
Somedays that you wish you don't wake up tomorrow.

Typical american is to never eat fried chicken but eat chicken nugget, pizza, and doritos. 
What is fun? Why don't I feel fun anymore. Wait was I ever having fun?
I wish tomorrow's me keep on staying committed and not be lazy. Let's try to make it productive two days in a row.
There's really not that much "News" in the science field.

Spent the day working on duckietown stuff, it really feels like duolingo to me (in a bad way). I don't know maybe I will give it a shot tomorrow but today's experience is kind of disappointing.
What can I do to improve my resume.. hmm

I want to start runing every morning at 7AM. That means I need to wake up at 6:30 every morning.

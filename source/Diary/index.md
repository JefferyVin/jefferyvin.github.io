### Sep 22, 2024

Ate half a pumpkin pie in the morning. The blood sugar crash caused my entire morning to be unproductive.
Thought about the court case. But there's not much I can do.
Played arknights, watched twitch, peeking at friend's discord call wondering what they are doing.
Wondering if SSM is something that is worth my time. Looked at UT/UIUC admission page again. I hope I get in.
Feel like I get stuck in a infinite loop very often (no compute -> no coding improvement -> doesnt justify getting more compute), but maybe I'm doing a bad job at getting myself out of this loop.
I wish tomorrow be a productive day, and I will figure out what I want to do with my life.

### Sep 23, 2024

Slept the whole morning until 12. 
Went through Tri Dao's blog on Mamba-2 also tried streaming it, but idk why I did that.
Had a little chat with Ryan when he's playing overwatch.
Called dad, played arknights. How does my day feel so short?
Maybe I perform better when starved.
The peppermint tea I bought is not high quality but I like it so far.
Oh yeah I saw my mugshots when I was arrested. Definately not a good feeling. Also I was so fat back then (probably because living healthy wasn't my priority back then with all the stuff going on) (Oh yeah I think I want to live by myself as I don't believe my parents respect my personal decisions)
There are somedays that you wish you don't wake up tomorrow, and today might be that day. (I hope people read this in the future and be like, this guy is suicidal. But I mean... It is irresponsible for everyone around you if you end your own life, life is pain, and sometime you can only pray for jesus to cut that rope.)
I wish tomorrow to be a productive day, and I will break out of the infinite loop.

I may have stayed up pretty late (like 4 am ish maybe) watching 爱情公寓.
I dont know why I watch/do these things but somes days I feel lobotomized.
I wonder what I should do on these kind of days.
Wondering whether I can make a convertor from guitar songs to guitar tabs.

# Sep 25, 2024

Spent my time thinking about knowledge distillation.
Somewhat productive day.
I've been pruning my existence away.
Somedays that you wish you don't wake up tomorrow.

# Sep 26, 2024

My empty ass resume. My low ass productivity. ENd me.

# Sep 27, 2024

Typical american is to never eat fried chicken but eat chicken nugget, pizza, and doritos. 
What is fun? Why don't I feel fun anymore. Wait was I ever having fun?
I wish tomorrow's me keep on staying committed and not be lazy. Let's try to make it productive two days in a row.
There's really not that much "News" in the science field.

# Sep 28, 2024

Spent the day working on duckietown stuff, it really feels like duolingo to me (in a bad way). I don't know maybe I will give it a shot tomorrow but today's experience is kind of disappointing.
What can I do to improve my resume.. hmm

# Sep 29, 2024

I want to start runing every morning at 7AM. That means I need to wake up at 6:30 every morning.

# Sep 30, 2024

OMG OMG OMG I GOT UIUC OFFER
This is going to be the greatest comeback story of all time. I need to accept this offer before 14th.

# Oct 1, 2024

I was torn about this offer i recieved.

# Oct 2, 2024

Dad made me feel bad yesterday, I realized I want to understand things deep and with a steady foundation.

# Oct 3, 2024

Ok productivity on KD, looked through some faculty in uiuc, dont know who I want to work with. I do have some inferiority complex academic wise.
I want to read all the kd paper tomorrow so time to sleep.

# Oct 4, 2024

Read 2.5 Papers on knowledge distillation. Then accidentally installed overwatch and played that for the rest of my day....

# Oct 5, 2024

Overwatch day with Ryan

# Oct 6, 2024

Read paper, game with Ryan

# Oct 7, 2024

I remembered I never had the knee jerk reflex since young age (ive faked it since at least 2015...). Well we will see if this means something.

# Oct 8, 2024

Tuesday
I feel like I have polluted my training set for the past 4 days... And got caught in the Ryan Vortex again...
I need to repent at the lost of focus wall...
I have been told by my immigration lawyer about my lawyer, maybe I need to start a company of somesorts.
Also my hair/head acne situation seems to go bad again, maybe I should stop using cheap shampoos.

# Oct 9, 2024

I basically played overwatch all day... (but at least I'm getting very good at tank!)
I should stop blaming ryan for my lack of self control. also I think he might be avoiding me...

# Oct 10/11, 2024

I got the court case in my mind. But things are going towards a better direction. I hope things work out well in the end. 
Still haven't heard back from UT yet, think im probably going to end up taking the UIUC MCS offer.
For the past week things have been pretty unproductive and I think maybe my friendship with Ryan is bad for me. This pains me a lot because I really enjoy being around him. But I've been somewhat toxic during games now since I value my time a lot more... I will come back whenever I become successful and have the leisure to game again.

# Oct 12, 2024

I dont remember what I did hey but at least..

# Oct 13, 2024

Pretty productive day!
Should I buy something for 修阿姨 for thanksgiving? hmm I'm thinking maybe a scarf but idk...

# Oct 14, 2024

Finally reading the 23 papers on the torchdistil repo, some papers are good and some are not as inspiring... maybe I'm reading them wrong

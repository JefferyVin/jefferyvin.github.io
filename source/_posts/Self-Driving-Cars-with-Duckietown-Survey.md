# Survey answers:

## When do you think a commercially viable autonomous mobility-on-demand service (autonomous taxis) will be deployed in cities? Give your best estimate in years.
2028

## When do you think we will be able to achieve "level 5 autonomy" (i.e., completely autonomous cars will be able to go anywhere a human can)? Give your best estimate in years.
2038

## What impact do you think Self-Driving Cars and/or other autonomous robotic systems will have on society?
I believe that autonomous robotic system (that is cheap enough to replace human labor) will cause the gap between upper class and low-middle class to further. In a hypothetical world where most physical work (delivery, cooking, etc.) can be replaced by robots, there are multiple things that could happen: More people starts exploring their inner values, people spend more time on dopamine rush (entertainment business boom or another baby boom) caused by lesser need to work, or government decides to leave the low-middle class on minimal life support and the upper class maintain their social status (but low-middle class lacks the means to reach upper class so they are stuck there forever). 
I personally prefer people starts exploring their inner values and everyone gets good education :)

## What are the biggest challenges facing the development and deployment of Self-Driving cars in society?
Maybe the blackbox nature of machine learning. Fine-tuning might be able to "Program" rules into self-driving models, but I believe it is better if there's a way to incorporate laws into self-driving cars.

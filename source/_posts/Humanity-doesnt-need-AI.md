Humanity doesn't need AGI, humanity need better search engine.

I think that we are on a trajectory to a good search engine. The developement of LLM definately made searching for things easier.

My original thoughts are the search engine should be 100% accurate when searching. However during the current training of the foundation model we cannot guarantee:
- Data Quality
- Ambiguity and Context
- Evolution of Knowledge

Therefore, I would agree with openai on their current trajectory which is merging 8 expert models together. The future of openai will most likely head towards Q&A/search engine style. I also kind of understand why they dont share the weights to the public cause it is their main product.

>what a horrible idea

Build the social media platform I want to use.  
We are paying the users in the starting phase of the Hivemind until we reached a critical mass. The users are welcomed to share their thoughts anonymously and the hivemind will be able to provide them how other people in the past have thought about the subject. The users are also welcomed to just ask questions.  
Once user's post has beeen posted the information will be sent to the hive mind and the information becomes uneditable after (temp) a month.   
The website will have ads but will not cater to ads aka (enagements).  
Hivemind will be powered by some sort of NLP that connects their post with other people's post of similar type. Hivemind will also have a chatbot model that allows the user to search through the entire hivemind dataset to see how people have dealt with similar circumstance.

- Question 1:
- How do we address the same problem with different context?
- A:
- we will try to find something with similar context or similar problem with the same context. 
- Maybe we will provide an opportunity for current user and the person who agrees the most with to communitcate with each other.
  - Which arises question: what if it caused the popular post user to be annoyed by the people trying to dm them 24/7? 
  - A:
  - They should be asked to write after being contacted: 
    - A final verdict:
      - meaning they dont want to be contacted with this quesiton anymore
    - A revision:
      - meaning they still welcome others to contact them about the subject
  - empathy driven, people in/been through similar circumstance will understand each other the best

- Question 2:
- How do we deal with change of information? Light is a wave. -> light is a particle as well
- A:
- It might be interesting to keep the outdated knowledge as a record to show how human knowledge have progressed throughout time. So maybe the users will allowed to use a old post as template. But ultimately we'll see but I'm aware of the problem.

- Question 3: 
- Algorithm manipulator?
- banned
- Human moderation (job/volunteer opportunity)
- account behavior moderation

Concerns from chatgpt: 
- Ad revenue sustainablility
  - Fundraising event (wikipedia style)
  - ad + fundraising (mixed style)
  - we'll see

Notes:
~~I would like it to have features like discord/QQ/Line but it shouldn't.~~  
Diffusion model???? (people are just saying the different word but they are having the same meaning but they still want to believe that they are different in some way) kind of like a seed in diffusion model (im just bsing)
Look at the age of the user (prevent cyberbullying)

the goal of hivemind is to point a direction when person encounters a dilemma and doesn't seem like there is a correct way to choose or the correct way is the painful way. Hivemind will provide people who have experienced similar things in the past and hopefully points the right decision for the person. For example, when my mom first got sick when i was 18. (It was just me and my mom in the states) I decided to not seek help from far relatives. It turned out to be a mistake. When my mom started having strange behaviors in the hospital, I didn't recognized how bad things could be and suffered for 6 month and is still suffering to this day.

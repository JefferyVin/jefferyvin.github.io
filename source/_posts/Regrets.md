What will I regret when I am about to die.

Wasting time playing video games in the early 20s.

But what Do i want to die as?
I want to die fulfilled. I want to be remembered after I die. I want to inspire other people to do good to the world. I want to let the less fortunate know that if there is a will there is a way.

I have very strong faith that if I put my mind on something, it would be done. The only problem is the lack of passion, so called the 三分钟热度. 
I don't have great vision or aspiration. A lot of what I do is slow and tedeous and small. 
I start writing about a perfect MMO that I want to make, but since I try to min max my time, I diverged from such goals.
I have a okay foundational knowledge about neural network and LLMs, but the technology just doesn seems to be there yet. I think there are multiple improvements that will be required to move AI to a next level: Higher quality datasets, the current model (Pre-LN Transformer) will never be able to reach the level of AGI, there seems like there are so many things that will need to be worked on. I am hesitant to go to academic side of things because it is proven to be a low profit generating side of the business. (This really make me feel like I'm making excuses) There are really a lot of things that could be worked on.

- Uni: Games, refused help, Ignorance, Imcompetence, Laziness

#### Letter to Myself

You are not a good son.
I don't know what happened in elementary school, but according to people you were cheating?
During middle school in china, you lied about your family background to other kids becasue you are ashamed to tell them that you have a common middle class family. You cheated on chinese test and helped others cheat in math test. Also you remember bullying your friend? Fighting your classmates? smh. Why waste the bus money to play video game in computer lab?
As for the middle school in Hawaii, you refused to go to church becasue you were brain washed by the chinese government. You are the Ipad kid. Sitting around on couch and watching youtube the whole time.
In Kalani high school, you sat around and played minecraft all day. You didn't keep track of homework because you thihnk the rules are the same as middle school. You joined the robotics club and is the "chief programmer" but you are still playing games all the time. Like, what are you doing man?
OK, learn from what you mom make you do when you were younger. Spend double the effort to reach the normal amount of success. But stay close with your family, talk to grandpa, grandma, your dad. Help the new church because pastor Fu helped you a lot, a lot when you were in need. Hug your mom and talk to her and show her efforts weren't in vein. There is a lot of temptations out there that will divert your path, while it is good to escape, just remember that talking to family is a better way to seek help. You also do not have social anxiety, you are just lazy and don't want to spend your "precious" time talking to people that are smarter than you. You are intemidated by them. Michael was right, you are an egotistical maniac with inferiority complex. This is also why you struggle to talk to the girls you like. 
It seems like you only got 2 ways now, either start humbling or become better. 

### Quotes from Letter to Detective Nickles

- There's multiple mistakes that I have made along the way:
  - I tried to continue school while I shouldn't
  - I didn't ask for help
  - I got burnt out and I wasn't aware of it

# A
It is a crazy concept that data scientists spent countless time filtering out garbages on the internet for LLMs, but we constantly put useless things inside of it. I believe that we need to have a correct training set distribution. 
This should be 65% of my training set. (10 hours)
* Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
* Mathematics
* Mechanical Engineering
* Brain and Cognitive Sciences
* Aeronautics and Astronautics
* Physics
* Game Theory
* Philosophy
* Biology
* Engineering Systems Division
* Nuclear Science and Engineering
* Chemistry
20% of my training set of how to survive. (3 hours)
10% of my training set should be to help me get along with people (1.5 hour)
5% of my training set is what fun is. (45 mins)

If I create AGI, I want it to be connected with the physical world as much as possible. However, it wont be limited to the physical world. I don't think the training speed should be fast in the beginning. It will be a timely process. I want a careful selection of materials learned by my AGI. 
This is similar to raising a kid, you provide them with core value. The rest of the way you let them develop. For example, one of the core value my mom provided me was that I won't do evil and will do good to the world. She got psychosis now, but I won't deviate from the original core value that my mom have taught me. 
What I just realized is that the core model of tha agi shouldnt be overly reliant on certain input, so dropout? (or something similar) 

### Muscle memory

Implies that our body incused small neural nets that is specific to that region and is disposable.

### Inference cost

Reduce the inferencing cost to optimize the neural network size. Or a neural network garbage collection.

### Object perception

How to create object perception.

### Logic
In simple terms, logic is just using the context to come up with next step

Will it be possible to secure a no bill from the grand jury. 
- need a good explanation

witness

trial of character? how idk.

proof of insanity:
impeaching testimony of prosecution witness, witness all acts of an unusual nature by the accused including both members of the accused's family and acquaintances and their opinions as to the sanity or insanity of the defendant. any record evidence of prior mental treatment, medical record. any letter written by the defendant at any time which tend to establish his mental condition. the psychologist who tested the defendant and the examining psychiatrist.

i have no problem of testifying

I need a iron clad proof of what I did is for the best interest of the people and the victim

proof the witness's words are crazy

jury statement:
- make the facts clear
- adjust my argument and words used to the experience of my audience
- use words of simple meaning and wherever possible, make the complex simple, by grouping or outlining same
- use the power of suggestion by aruguing my point in as many different ways as possible
- be tactful, not blunt,
- lead audience by rationalizing with them, not by driving them
- adopt I can see your point of view but you also need to consider the additional circumstances etc.

I wanted to make a difference, I wanted to start a company, I need knowledge of things, I want to become a 大家 maybe a 专家 at some field. I also want to surround myself with people that have the same passion as me instead of commoners even though people are mostly the same but I want to improve while socializing. That's why I need to go to graduate school. But my resume is thin currently, so I need to improve it by becoming a expert by doing things.
